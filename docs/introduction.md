# Introduction

RCGAL is a computational geometry algorithm library of Rust, it is **not** a Rust binding of the [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/), but a new library that is inspired by the CGAL.

RCGAL is still in the early state of development, and it is not ready for production use, but you can try it out and give feedback to help improve it.

This tutorial will guide you through the basic usage of the RCGAL.
