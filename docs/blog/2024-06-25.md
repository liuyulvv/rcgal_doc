We are glad to announce that the `Circle2` and `Arc2` types have been added to the RCGAL. The `Circle2` type represents a circle, and the `Arc2` type represents an arc of a circle. The old `Segment2` type has been renamed to `LineSegment2`, and the `Segment2` `trait` has been added.

The `Location` and `Intersection` of the `Circle2` and `Arc2` types have been implemented.

We optimized the `Intersection`, you can get check if two segments intersect through the `is_segment_2_segment_2_intersected` function, and get the intersection point through the `segment_2_segment_2_intersection` function, no matter the segments are lines, circles, or arcs.

The `sweep_line_segment_2_intersection` function has been removed, and the `sweep_segment_2_intersection` function has been added. You can get the intersection points of a bunch of segments, no matter the segments are lines, circles, or arcs.

Thanks for your interest in the RCGAL, and I hope we can learn and grow together.
