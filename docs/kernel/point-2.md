# Point2

`Point2` is a two-dimensional point in the Cartesian coordinate system. It is a fundamental concept of the kernel, which is used to represent the coordinates of geometric objects. Point2 is a generic type in RCGAL, which means you can use any type that implements the `NumberType` trait as the number type.

Point2 has two fields: `x` and `y`, which represent the x and y coordinates of the point, respectively. You can access these fields directly, or use the `x()` and `y()` methods to get the x and y coordinates, respectively.
