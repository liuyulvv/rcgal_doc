# RCGAL

Rust Computational Geometry Algorithms Library.

RCGAL is still in the early state of development, and the API is not stable yet.

RCGAL is **not** a Rust binding of [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/), but a new library that is inspired by the CGAL.

The main goal of RCGAL now is to provide a set of basic 2D geometric algorithms. The documentation is still in progress.
